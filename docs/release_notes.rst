Release Notes
=============

v4.1.0
------

:date: 2019-10-17

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

* In the Model's Meta, you may now provide an AWS session token, which is mostly useful for assumed roles (#700)::

    sts_client = boto3.client("sts")
    role_object = sts_client.assume_role(RoleArn=role_arn, RoleSessionName="role_name", DurationSeconds=BOTO3_CLIENT_DURATION)
    role_credentials = role_object["Credentials"]

    class MyModel(Model):
      class Meta:
        table_name = "table_name"
        aws_access_key_id = role_credentials["AccessKeyId"]
        aws_secret_access_key = role_credentials["SecretAccessKey"]
        aws_session_token = role_credentials["SessionToken"]

      hash = UnicodeAttribute(hash_key=True)
      range = UnicodeAttribute(range_key=True)

* Fix warning about `inspect.getargspec` (#701)
* Fix provisioning GSIs when using pay-per-request billing (#690)

v4.0.0
--------

:date: 2019-04-10

This is major release and contains breaking changes. Please read the notes below carefully.

**Requests Removal**

Given that ``botocore`` has moved to using ``urllib3`` directly for making HTTP requests, we'll be doing the same (via ``botocore``). This means the following:

* The ``session_cls`` option is no longer supported.
* The ``request_timeout_seconds`` parameter is no longer supported. ``connect_timeout_seconds`` and ``read_timeout_seconds`` are available instead.

  + Note that the timeouts for connection and read are now ``15`` and ``30`` seconds respectively. This represents a change from the previous ``60`` second combined ``requests`` timeout.
* *Wrapped* exceptions (i.e ``exc.cause``) that were from ``requests.exceptions`` will now be comparable ones from ``botocore.exceptions`` instead.

**Key attribute types must match table**

The previous release would call `DescribeTable` to discover table metadata
and would use the key types as defined in the DynamoDB table. This could obscure
type mismatches e.g. where a table's hash key is a number (`N`) in DynamoDB,
but defined in PynamoDB as a `UnicodeAttribute`.

With this release, we're always using the PynamoDB model's definition
of all attributes including the key attributes.

**Deprecation of old APIs**

Support for `Legacy Conditional Parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.html>`_ has been
removed. See a complete list of affected ``Model`` methods below:

* ``update_item``: removed in favor of ``update``.
* ``rate_limited_scan``: removed in favor of ``scan`` and ``ResultIterator``.

  + Relatedly, the ``allow_rate_limited_scan_without_consumed_capacity`` option has been removed.
* ``delete``: ``conditional_operator`` and ``**expected_values`` kwargs removed. Use ``condition`` instead.
* ``update``: ``attributes``, ``conditional_operator`` and ``**expected_values`` kwargs removed. Use ``actions`` and ``condition`` instead.
* ``save``: ``conditional_operator`` and ``**expected_values`` kwargs removed. Use ``condition`` instead.
* ``count``: ``**filters`` kwargs removed. Use ``range_key_condition``/``filter_condition`` instead.
* ``query``: ``conditional_operator`` and ``**filters`` kwargs removed. Use ``range_key_condition``/``filter_condition`` instead.
* ``scan``: ``conditional_operator`` and ``**filters`` kwargs removed. Use ``filter_condition`` instead.

When upgrading, pay special attention to use of ``**filters`` and ``**expected_values``, as you'll need to check for arbitrary names that correspond to
attribute names. Also keep an eye out for kwargs like ``user_id__eq=5`` or ``email__null=True``, which are no longer supported. If you're not already using
``mypy`` to type check your code, it can help you catch cases like these.

New features in this release:

* Support for transactions (``TransactGet`` and ``TransactWrite``) (#618)
* Support for versioned optimistic locking (#664)

Other changes in this release:

* Python 2.6 is no longer supported. 4.x.x will be the last major release to support Python 2.7 given the upcoming EOL.
* Added the ``max_pool_connection`` and ``extra_headers`` settings to replace common use cases for ``session_cls``
* Added support for `moto <https://github.com/spulec/moto>`_ through implementing the botocore "before-send" hook.
* Performance improvements to ``UTCDateTimeAttribute`` deserialization. (#610)
* The ``MapAttributeMeta`` class has been removed. Now ``type(MapAttribute) == AttributeContainerMeta``.
* Removed ``LegacyBooleanAttribute`` and the read-compatibility for it in ``BooleanAttribute``.
* `None` can now be used to bootstrap condition chaining (#653)
* Allow specifying timedeltas in expressions involving TTLAttributes (#665)

v3.2.0
------

:date: 2017-10-13

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

This release updates PynamoDB to interact with Dynamo via the current version of Dynamo's API.
Condition and update expressions can now be created from attributes and used in model operations.
Legacy filter and attribute update keyword arguments have been deprecated. Using these arguments
will cause a warning to be logged.

New features in this release:

* Add support for current version of `DynamoDB API <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Appendix.CurrentAPI.html>`_
* Improved ``MapAttribute`` item assignment and access.

Contributors to this release:

* @jpinner-lyft


v3.2.0rc2
---------

:date: 2017-10-09

This is a backwards compatible, release candidate.

This release candidate allows dereferencing raw ``MapAttributes`` in condition expressions.
It also improves ``MapAttribute`` assignment and access.

Contributors to this release:

* @jpinner-lyft


v3.2.0rc1
---------

:date: 2017-09-22

This is a backwards compatible, release candidate.

This release candidate updates PynamoDB to interact with Dynamo via the current version of Dynamo's API.
It deprecates some internal methods that were used to interact with Dynamo that are no longer relevant.
If your project was calling those low level methods a warning will be logged.

New features in this release:

* Add support for current version of `DynamoDB API <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Appendix.CurrentAPI.html>`_

Contributors to this release:

* @jpinner-lyft


v3.1.0
------

:date: 2017-07-07

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

Note that we now require ``botocore>=1.2.0``; this is required to support the
``consistent_read`` parameter when scanning.

Calling ``Model.count()`` without a ``hash_key`` and *with* ``filters`` will
raise a ``ValueError``, as it was previously returning incorrect results.

New features in this release:

* Add support for signals via blinker (#278)

Fixes in this release:

* Pass batch parameters down to boto/dynamo (#308)
* Raise a ValueError if count() is invoked with no hash key AND filters (#313)
* Add consistent_read parameter to Model.scan (#311)

Contributors to this release:

* @jmphilli
* @Lordnibbler
* @lita


v3.0.1
------

:date: 2017-06-09

This is a major release with breaking changes.

``MapAttribute`` now allows pythonic access when recursively defined.
If you were not using the ``attr_name=`` kwarg then you should have no problems upgrading.
Previously defined non subclassed ``MapAttributes`` (raw ``MapAttributes``) that were members of a subclassed ``MapAttribute`` (typed ``MapAttributes``) would have to be accessed like a dictionary.
Now object access is possible and recommended. See [here](https://github.com/pynamodb/PynamoDB/blob/master/pynamodb/tests/test_attributes.py#L671) for a test example.
Access via the ``attr_name``, also known as the DynamoDB name, will now throw an ``AttributeError``.

``UnicodeSetAttributes`` do not json serialize or deserialize anymore.
We deprecated the functionality of json serializing as of ``1.6.0`` but left the deserialization functionality in there so people could migrate away from the old functionality.
If you have any ``UnicodeSetAttributes`` that have not been persisted since version ``1.6.0`` you will need to migrate your data or manage the json encoding and decoding with a custom attribute in application.

* Performance enhancements for the ``UTCDateTimeAttribute`` deserialize method. (#277)
* There was a regression with attribute discovery. Fixes attribute discovery for model classes with inheritance (#280)
* Fix to ignore null checks for batch delete (#283)
* Fix for ``ListAttribute`` and ``MapAttribute`` serialize (#286)
* Fix for ``MapAttribute`` pythonic access (#292) This is a breaking change.
* Deprecated the json decode in ``UnicodeSetAttribute`` (#294) This is a breaking change.
* Raise ``TableDoesNotExist`` error instead of letting json decoding ``ValueErrors`` raise (#296)

v2.2.0
------

:date: 2017-10-25

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

The purpose of this release is to prepare users to upgrade to v3.0.1+
(see issue #377 for details).

Pull request #294 removes the backwards compatible deserialization of
UnicodeSetAttributes introduced in #151.

This release introduces a migration function on the Model class to help
re-serialize any data that was written with v1.5.4 and below.

Temporary feature in this release:

* Model.fix_unicode_set_attributes() migration helper
# Model.needs_unicode_set_fix() migration helper


v2.1.6
------

:date: 2017-05-10

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

Fixes in this release:

* Replace Delorean with dateutil (#208)
* Fix a bug with count -- consume all pages in paginated response (#256)
* Update mock lib (#262)
* Use pytest instead of nose (#263)
* Documentation changes (#269)

v2.1.5
------

:date: 2017-03-16

Fixes in this release:

* Apply retry to ProvisionedThroughputExceeded (#222)
* rate_limited_scan fix to handle consumed capacity (#235)
* Fix for test when dict ordering differs (#237)

Contributors to this release:

* @anandswaminathan
* @jasonfriedland
* @JohnEmhoff


v2.1.4
------

:date: 2017-02-14

This is a minor release, with some changes to `MapAttribute` handling. Previously,
when accessing a `MapAttribute` via `item.attr`, the type of the object used during
instantiation would determine the return value. `Model(attr={...})` would return
a `dict` on access. `Model(attr=MapAttribute(...))` would return an instance of
`MapAttribute`. After #223, a `MapAttribute` will always be returned during
item access regardless of the type of the object used during instantiation. For
convenience, a `dict` version can be accessed using `.as_dict()` on the `MapAttribute`.

New features in this release:

* Support multiple attribute update (#194)
* Rate-limited scan (#205)
* Always create map attributes when setting a dict (#223)

Fixes in this release:

* Remove AttributeDict and require explicit attr names (#220)
* Add distinct DoesNotExist classes per model (#206)
* Ensure defaults are respected for MapAttribute (#221)
* Add docs for GSI throughput changes (#224)

* Allow raw map attributes in subclassed map attributes (#199)

Contributors to this release:

* @jmphilli


v2.0.2
------

:date: 2016-11-10

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

Fixes in this release:

* add BOOL into SHORT_ATTR_TYPES (#190)
* deserialize map attributes correctly (#192)
* prepare request with requests session so session properties are applied (#197)

Contributors to this release:

* @anandswaminathan
* @jmphilli
* @yedpodtrzitko


v2.0.1
------

:date: 2016-11-04

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

Fixes in this release:

* make "unprocessed keys for batch operation" log at info level (#180)
* fix RuntimeWarning during imp_load in custom settings file (#185)
* allow unstructured map attributes (#186)

Contributors to this release:

* @danielhochman
* @jmphilli
* @bedge


v2.0.0
------

:date: 2016-11-01

This is a major release, which introduces support for native DynamoDB maps and lists. There are no
changes which are expected to break backwards compatibility, but you should test extensively before
upgrading in production due to the volume of changes.

New features in this release:

* Add support for native map and list attributes (#175)

Contributors to this release:

* @jmphilli
* @berdim99


v1.6.0
------

:date: 2016-10-20

This is a minor release, with some changes to BinaryAttribute handling and new options for configuration.

BooleanAttribute now uses the native API type "B". BooleanAttribute is also compatible with the legacy BooleanAttributes
on read. On save, they will be rewritten with the native type. If you wish to avoid this behavior, you can continue
to use LegacyBooleanAttribute. LegacyBooleanAttribute is also forward compatible with native boolean
attributes to allow for migration.

New features in this release:

* Add support for native boolean attributes (#149)
* Parse legacy and native bool in legacy bool (#158)
* Allow override of settings from global configuration file (#147)

Fixes in this release:

* Serialize UnicodeSetAttributes correctly (#151)
* Make update_item respect attr_name differences (#160)

Contributors to this release:

* @anandswaminathan
* @jmphilli
* @lita


v1.5.4
------

:date: 2017-10-25

This is a backwards compatible, minor bug fix release.

The purpose of this release is to prepare users to upgrade to v1.6.0+
(see issue #377 for details).

Pull request #151 introduces a backwards incompatible change to how
UnicodeSetAttributes are serialized. While the commit attempts to
provide compatibility by deserializing values written with v1.5.3 and
below, it prevents users from upgrading because it starts writing non
JSON-encoded values to dynamo.

Anyone using UnicodeSetAttribute must first deploy this version.

Fixes in this release:

* Backport UnicodeSetAttribute deserialization code from #151


v1.5.3
------

:date: 2016-08-08

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

Fixes in this release:

* Introduce concept of page_size, separate from num items returned limit (#139)

Contributors to this release:

* @danielhochman


v1.5.1
------

:date: 2016-05-11

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

Fixes in this release:

* Fix for binary attribute handling of unprocessed items data corruption affecting users of 1.5.0 (#126 fixes #125)

Contributors to this release:

* @danielhochman


v1.5.0
------

:date: 2016-05-09

This is a backwards compatible, minor release.

Please consider the fix for limits before upgrading. Correcting for off-by-one when querying is
no longer necessary.

Fixes in this release:

* Fix off-by-one error for limits when querying (#123 fixed #95)
* Retry on ConnectionErrors and other types of RequestExceptions (#121 fixes #98)
* More verbose logging when receiving errors e.g. InternalServerError from the DynamoDB API (#115)
