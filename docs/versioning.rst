Versioning Scheme
=================

PynamoDB conforms to `PEP 440 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/>`__.
Generally, PynamoDB uses `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`__, where the version number has
the format:

``MAJOR`` . ``MINOR`` . ``PATCH``

* The ``MAJOR`` version number changes when backward *incompatible* changes are introduced.
* The ``MINOR`` version number changes when new features are added, but are backward compatible.
* The ``PATCH`` version number changes when backward compatible bug fixes are added.
