# It turns out we "actually" require >=1.6.0 for folks on Python 3.6 because of:
#
#   https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/1079
#
# This was discovered as a result of integration tests that exercised boto. However, until 4.x
# we didn't want to bump the actual dependency of the library for consumers as it would effectively
# be a breaking change. As a result, we use the 1.6.0 dependency for development here for the
# purpose of integration tests, even though requirements.txt still has 1.2.0.
